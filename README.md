# Working Theory: A Framework for Cosmic Realism

**Working Theory** is an open-source philosophical document exploring what it means to live without religion, but not without meaning. It's grounded in science, existential realism, and conscious humility.

This is not a religion. Not a belief system. Not an answer.

It’s a map of thought for those who reject mythology, fear certainty, and still want to live with awe.

### Why This Exists

Most people are stuck between two extremes:
- Blind faith in ancient dogma  
- Cold nihilism dressed as intellectualism

**Cosmic Realism** is the middle path:
- It honors science, but not scientism  
- It respects consciousness, but not myth  
- It finds the sacred in awareness, not worship

This document was created to preserve that mindset, for anyone else who gets here and needs proof that they’re not alone.

### Use It However You Want

- Quote it

- Turn it into art

This theory isn’t final. It’s alive.
