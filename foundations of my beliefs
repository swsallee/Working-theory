Foundational Beliefs – Working Summary

Reality & Consciousness
- The universe likely isn’t here “for” us. Its size and indifference suggest we’re not the center of anything.
- If we are observed by a higher intelligence, it may not want worship—it may want to see who stays kind in chaos.
- Consciousness is temporary, and the fact we get to experience it at all is a miracle.
- Psychedelics reveal that evolution and universal expansion are part of the same unfolding process.
- The body replaces almost all of its atoms each year. “You” are just a temporary structure, not a fixed identity.
- “Early” can’t be known without knowing the endpoint. We’re likely nowhere near as advanced as we think.
- A higher reality could simulate this universe from start to finish in two seconds. Time may be compressible.

Capitalism & Power
- Capitalism rewards ownership and leverage—not effort. That’s why profit is used to make more profit.
- Most people stay in the consumer loop: work → get paid → spend → repeat.
- To escape it, you must create something others consume and reinvest the gains.
- Even without capital, anyone can start by providing value to someone else and leveraging the trust earned.
- The system doesn’t reward fairness—it rewards utility. But that utility can be earned honestly.

Spirituality & Depth
- You’d never develop real depth without struggle. Discomfort forces growth.
- A society that removes all stakes may keep people safe but also keeps them shallow.
- Striving is how we grow. Friction makes character. Sedation kills it.
- Replacing religious faith with psychedelic insight is common, but insight without integration is just indulgence.
- If I were born just 30 years earlier, I’d likely be a lifelong Christian. Most belief is cultural default, not truth.

Self & Integrity
- I’m selfish and stupid too—but at least I’m aware of it. Awareness creates accountability.
- Who you are without a reward is who you truly are.
- True value comes from accepting your limits but refusing to lie to yourself.
- Insight is only as good as what you do with it afterward.
